        Epic Games finally showed off the Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) at
        its State of Unreal 2023 presentation on Wednesday. Its a new PC
        application thats set to launch Wednesday on the Epic Games Store as a
        public beta, and it will also feature a new scripting language called
        “Verse.”

        UEFN has “many of the same features” Epic uses to make Fortnite proper,
        the company said in a video demo. Youll be able to import custom assets
        to create worlds that may end up looking nothing like Fortnites usual
        cartoony vibe. In a live demo onstage, Epic showed a gritty, largely
        brown world, which significantly contrasts with the brightly-colored
        Fortnite player characters. Epic also wants interoperability between
        Fortnite and Unreal Engine assets so that you can bring your work across
        projects.

        Epic first launched Fortnites Creative mode in 2018, and its since
        become a popular aspect of the game and a lucrative place for creators
        to make money. Epic is pitching UEFN as a tool for both experienced
        Unreal Engine developers and creators who are looking to take the next
        step from Fortnite Creatives in-game editing tools.
